Q1 : What have I learnt during this release ?
Ans : 
1. Use of ViewModel and ViewModelFactory to separate the UI component from the  other components
2. Make the app's data to survive the configuration changes.
3. Use of UIScope and Coroutines .
4. Use of Room Database.
5. Adding Click listeners directly in the XML using ViewModel concepts.
6. Use of HTML formatting to display the data.
7. More understanding of Layout files.
8. Spotted an error due to the start of a package name with Capital Letter.
9. Use of Suspend function while doint IO operations.
10. Using ViewModelFactory to pass arguments to ViewModel ( If that's how we say it..haha)
11. one error regarding missing implementation of database was just solved by adding "kapt "androidx.room:room-compiler:$room_version"" in App level dependency.
