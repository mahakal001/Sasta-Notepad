1. I added floating action button to title fragment. Then i needed to put a listener on it. For that I had to generate a binding. While trying to compile the kotlin code for the same, The error was something like "unable to generate viewBinding". 
Solution : The error was spotted in corresponding .xml file. Wrapped the constraint layout in linear layout. The issue was solved 

2. Connected title fragment to notetaking fragment. But app crashed when jumping from title fragment to noteTakingFragment.
Ans. The reason was i had added two fragment in activity_main.xml. But there should be only one fragment in it which is NavHostFragment. It by default navigate you to title_fragment because i guess ( not sure) that whichever fragment is added first to the Navigation.xml is chosen by NavHostFragment to navigate to when app is launched. This can be wrong assumption. Lets see
